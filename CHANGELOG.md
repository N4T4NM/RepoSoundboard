# R.E.P.O Soundboard Changelogs

## v 1.0.1
- Increased wav playback performance
- Ensure that the audio playback stops

## v 1.0.2
- Changed settings path to game root folder

**Only after the update I noticed that the mod manager will delete files inside the mod folder. 
If you still have you `soundboard_settings.json` file inside the mod folder, please move it to the game's root folder before updating or it will be lost.**
